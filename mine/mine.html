<h1>Why My website is better than theirs.</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Becasue I made it</li>
  <li>The tables make it highly structured.</li>
  <li>The image shows what's possible in planting an aquarium with live plants instead of just showing some random picture of a fish. THat is to say, my pictorial content has the potential to be far more inspiring.</li>
</ul>
