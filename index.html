    <ul>
      <li>Fish eating each other</li>
      <li>water smelling horrible</li>
      <li>so much cleaning of the tank and glass that you NEVER are able to enjoy actually having the tank!</li>
      <li>your friend spent alllll this money on fish, but then they died within the first month. Spontaneously! NO CLUE WHAT HAPPENED!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's true that owning an aquarium can be quite the headache- heck, it still is for biologist working at national and state aquariums!- but with a little guidance and some common sense, we'll make setting your first tank easy... or, at least a lot less a pain in the butt.</p>

                <li>You bought a BUNCH of new fish at once, and they presented the tank with so much bio waste, that a bloom of beneficial microorganisms occurred. Though beneficial, the organisms that handle animal waste in water produce poisonous intermediates, and if one part of the cycle doesn't grow as quickly as other parts, your tank will get poisoned! This is often what's referred to as an Aquarium "Crashing" </li>
                <li> Similar to the previous point, you took SO much of the old water out in a water change, that your beneficial microorganisms were wiped out, sending your tank back in time to then it was just being set up... Only, your tank isn't old. It's established, and thanks to your well-intended water change, it's on its way to Crashing!</li>
